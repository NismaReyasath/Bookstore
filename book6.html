        <h2>Black Holes: The Key to Understanding the Universe</h2>
        <p>by Brian Cox, Jeff Forshaw</p>
        <p>Price: RS 599</p>
        <p>By the star physicist and author of multiple #1 Sunday Times bestsellers, a major and definitive narrative work on black holes and how they can help us understand the universe.

<br><br>Of all the many scientific marvels occurring in our universe, perhaps none have been more consistently intriguing and mysterious than black holes. What are they, exactly? How do they form? And what can they tell us about the nature and future of our universe?

<br><br>Renowned physicist Brian Cox has dedicated his career to presenting complicated scientific ideas in an engaging way, from his popular BBC podcast "The Infinite Monkey Cage," to his frequently sold-out speaking events, to his bestselling books written with fellow physicist Jeff Forshaw. Now the two team up once again with Horizons, an exploration of these amazing objects--and why they continue to confirm that Einstein's theory of general relativity is such a brilliant explanation of the universe around us.<br></p>
